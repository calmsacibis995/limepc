# limepc
A A/UX emulator, based on Shoebill.

# How to build
For now, it is not recommended to use the native macOS-based application. Use the SDL2 version instead.  
Install the following dependancies: `brew install glfw glew`.  
Clone this repo.  
Type `cd limepc/sdl-gui`. Then run `make macos`.  
If successful, you should have a `shoebill` binary.

# Things to do
Write a new graphical interface for macOS hosts. (If someone can contribute a working graphical application that can work without SDL2, please let me know!)
